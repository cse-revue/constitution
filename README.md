# CSE Revue Constitution

**Goal**: to move the constitution from the pain that is a .docx file to something easier to read/edit/share, e.g. Markdown.
Maybe in the future we can have sections hyperlinked somehow so that we can easily follow-up references within the
constitution. (Specfically, raw text file --> latex with hyyperref --> pretty hyperlinked pdf)

# TODO
- upload current .docx constitution
- proofread, make sure numbering/order etc is retained
- find out why Section 1.7 is blank (occurs in `.docx` and `.pdf` versions too)
- make branch for converting doc into a web format (HTML/CSS/Markdown/whatever)
- make branch for converting to PDF (LaTeX with hyperref or equivalent)

# Format
- indents are ~~two spaces~~ however they were done in the conversion to raw `.txt` files (it should be consistent across all the raw text files)
- retain numbering/dot-point format
